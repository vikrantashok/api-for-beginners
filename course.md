# Introduction to APIs

## Unit 1 - What is an API

In this unit we'll define what an API, or Application Programming Interface is and why you should use them.
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two 
applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or 
check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
